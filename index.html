LEARNING SKILLS
think of what happened when you succseded getting to somewhere you wanted.
    -smash melee
    -osu
    -skateboarding

this proves. you can do it no problem. the method is good, you just need to slowly increase the challange and practice your weak points a whole
lot of times.
heres a full guide. 
1. introduce yourself (dip your toes)
2. get the different tools you need
3. LEARN WHAT IT IS, AND WHAT ITS FOR. (either a guide, or reverse engineer) 
3. jump into the challenge but only copy. make it more and more challanging
4. make something cool using it.

START BY OPENING GOOGLE KEEP. AND JUST PLAN.

GETTING PROJECTS DONE
put a timer on (dosent matter if you fail)
draw a bubble of ur goal. in a chain, find everything you need
or 
copy a successful example. change it up slightly, see what things do

i.e, oh! i need to build a lamp, what is the components of a lamp, well reverse engineer an example. theres 
-stand
-light
-drapes
