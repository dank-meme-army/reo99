LEARNING SKILLS
think of what happened when you succseded getting to somewhere you wanted.
    -smash melee
    -osu
    -skateboarding

this proves. you can do it no problem. the method is good, you just need to slowly increase the challange and practice your weak points a whole
lot of times.
heres a full guide. 
1. introduce yourself (dip your toes)
2. understand what fully to do 
3. jump into the challange but lowered difficulty. 
4. try to get more and more skills

GETTING PROJECTS DONE
put a timer on (dosent matter if you fail)
Just pull up a doc and write where you are and what you want to do. 
Then break that task down into basic parts from start to finish. Just try what you think you need to do
or
copy a succsesful example.

i.e, oh! i need to build a lamp, what is the components of a lamp, well reverse engineer an example. theres 
-stand
-light
-drapes
